Hello, I’m Aysun: a curious researcher, thoughtful builder, and quietly determined person with a deep interest in human behavior, technology, and how the two intersect.

This space is a reflection of what I care about: meaningful work, creativity in data, and the joy of learning. It’s where I share my research, side projects, and thoughts, not just as credentials, but as parts of a journey.

Welcome, and thank you for stopping by.
