Hi, I’m Aysun.  

I care about how people think, what shapes their choices, and how data can help us understand the world a little better. I’ve spent the last few years working on research that blends human behavior, technology, and curiosity.

At the heart of it, I believe in being a lifelong learner. This site is a quiet corner for the things I’ve built, studied, and cared about... from research and projects to ideas I’ve been sitting with... Just the parts that feel most like me.

Thanks for visiting.  Welcome!
