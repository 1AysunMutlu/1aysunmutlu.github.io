### ðŸ”§ Rail Detection with 3D LiDAR (CN Rail, 2024)
As a Data Scientist at Canadian National Railway, I developed a 3D LiDAR segmentation model using learning-based approaches (XGBoost, FCN) for rail localization. This contributed to asset management, maintenance scheduling, and digital twin development.

### ðŸ§  Promotion Optimization Engine (PhD Thesis)
Built a reinforcement learning model to personalize promotions based on customer engagement. Used real-world data to optimize offers over a 12-week period. Included MILP baselines and treatment effect estimation.

### ðŸ“Š Marketing Analytics Dashboard
Built a Python-based dashboard for visualizing average order value (AOV), purchase probability, and promotion impact across customer segments.

### ðŸ§­ Travel Recommender System
Personal side project combining NLP and location data to suggest travel destinations. Used Python, scikit-learn, and OpenAI embeddings.
