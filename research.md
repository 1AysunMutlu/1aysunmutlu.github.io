My research focuses on understanding and optimizing customer behavior in digital marketplaces.

I recently completed a PhD in Operations Management at McGill University, where I designed and executed a randomized field experiment to understand how different types of promotions impact customer behavior over time. I used heterogeneous treatment effect analysis and reinforcement learning to personalize promotional strategies based on customer engagement and long-term value.

Key areas of interest:
- Promotion framing and customer psychology
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning for marketing optimization
- Causal inference in digital experiments
- Customer lifetime value modeling
- Subscription and platform business analytics

Notable methodologies:
- Randomized controlled trials (RCT)
- Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
- Q-learning and explainable RL
- A/B testing and heterogeneous treatment effect modeling
