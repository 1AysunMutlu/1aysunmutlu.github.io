My research focuses on understanding and influencing customer behavior in digital marketplaces, with a particular interest in decision-making, engagement, and long-term value.

I recently completed a PhD in Operations Management at McGill University. My dissertation involved designing and running randomized field experiments with a subscription-based meal kit service to study how different types of promotions; in timing, framing, customization and structure, affect customer retention and behavior over time.

I used techniques from causal inference, optimization, and reinforcement learning to build models that not only explain customer responses but also recommend when and how to act.

### What I‚Äôve worked on

- **Promotion design and timing optimization**  
  How and when to offer incentives for sustainable customer engagement  

- **Reinforcement learning for marketing strategy**  
  Using Q-learning and multi-agent setups to balance short- and long-term goals  

- **Causal inference in field experiments**  
  Uplift modeling, heterogeneous treatment effects, and difference-in-differences  

- **Customer lifetime value (CLV) prediction**  
  Forecasting retention, churn, and order value using behavioral and contextual data  

- **Recommender systems for retention**  
  Built hybrid recommenders combining behavioral signals, product metadata, and image features
