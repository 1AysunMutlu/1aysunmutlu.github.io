Hi, I’m Aysun.

I recently completed my PhD in Operations Management at McGill University, where I studied how people respond to promotions and how data and thoughtful modelling can help us design better experiences. My work brings together behavioural insights, machine learning, and real-world impact.

Outside academia, I’ve worked as a Data Scientist in both tech and industry, most recently at Canadian National Railway. I've built models to detect rail tracks from 3D LiDAR, forecast customer value, and personalize promotions. Across projects, I try to balance rigour with empathy, ensuring the models serve the people, not just the metrics.

When I’m not thinking about data or design, I’m probably travelling, taking photos or writing. I’ve visited over 25 countries and 70+ cities, with a soft spot for journeys, architecture, and long walks through unfamiliar neighbourhoods. Montreal has been home for the past few years. I’ve always liked it; it brings me peace, but I’m also itching to experience another city soon.

This site is a mix of work and curiosity; part portfolio, part personal space.  
Thanks for being here.
