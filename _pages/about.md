Hi, I’m Aysun.

I recently completed my PhD in Operations Management at McGill University, where I studied how people respond to promotions, and how data and thoughtful modeling can help us design better experiences. My work brings together behavioral insight, machine learning, and optimization.

Outside academia, I’ve worked as a Data Scientist in both tech and industry, most recently at Canadian National Railway. I've built models to detect rail tracks from 3D LiDAR, forecast customer value, and personalize promotions. Across projects, I try to turn complexity into something clear, useful, and grounded in the real world.

When I’m not thinking about data or design, I’m probably traveling. I’ve visited over 25 countries and 70+ cities. With a soft spot for journeys, architecture, and long walks through new neighborhoods. Montreal has been home for the past few years, and the backdrop to this beautiful chapter.

This site is a mix of work and curiosity; part portfolio, part personal space.  
Thanks for being here.
