Hi, I'm Aysun.

I recently completed my PhD in Operations Management at McGill University, where I explored how people respond to promotions and how we can use data and thoughtful modelling to understand and improve that experience. My research blends behavioural insight, machine learning, and optimization.

Beyond academia, I’ve worked in industry as a Data Scientist, most recently at Canadian National Railway. I’ve built models that detect rails from 3D LiDAR, forecast customer value, and personalize promotions. I love turning complexity into clarity.

When I’m not thinking about data or design, I’m probably travelling. I’ve visited over 25 countries and 70+ cities and have a soft spot for airplanes and neighbourhood walks. Montreal has been home for the past few years, and the backdrop to this beautiful chapter.

This site is both a portfolio and a personal space. Thanks for being here.
